# Chapter 3: Decision Control Instruction
## Notes

- There are three ways for taking decisions in a program. First way is to use the if-else statement, second way is to use the 
conditional operators and third way is to use the switch statement.
- The default scope of the if statement is only the next statement. So, to execute more than one statement they must
be written in a pair of braces.
- An if block need not always be associated with an else block. However, an else block is always associated with an if
statement.
- If the outcome of an if-else ladder is only one of two answers then the ladder should be replaced either with an else-if clause or by logical operators.
- && and || are binary operators, whereas, ! is a unary operator.
- In C every test expression is evaluated in terms of zero and non-zero values. A zero value is considered to be false and a
non-zero value is considered to be true.
- Assignment statements used with conditional operators must be enclosed within a pair of parenthesis.
