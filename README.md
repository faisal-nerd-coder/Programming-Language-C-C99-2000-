# Programming-Language-C-C99-2000-
C is a programming language developed at AT & T Bell Lab of USA in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie.

History Of Langauge C -

1978: Published by Brian Kernighan & Dennis Ritchie.

1983: ANSI for a committee, X3J11 to establish a standard specification in C.

1989: ANSI standards were completed and ratified as ANSI X3.159-1989 "Programming Language C" also referred as ANSI C or c89.

1995: ISO published an extension to ANSI C, referred as ISO C.

2000: ANSI adopted ISO C, Referred as C99.

All the programes or codes in this repository are based on C99 Standard.
# Chapter 1: Summary

## Notes

3 top reasons for learning C

- Good base for learning C++, c#, or Java Later.
- Unix, Linux, Windows, Gaming frameworks are written in C.
- Embeded systems programs are written in C.


* Constants = Literals -> Cannot Change
* Variables = Identifiers -> May Change
* Types of variables and constants: 1) Primary 2) Secondary.
* 3 types in Primary : 1) integer 2) Real (Float) 3) Character.
* Ranges
    1) 2-bytes integers: -32768 to +32767.
    2) 4-bytes integers: -2147438648 to +2147438647.
    3) Floats : -3.4 x 10^38 to +3.4 x 10^38.
* In a char constant, both quotes must slant to the left, like 'A'.
* Variable has two meanings:
    1) It is a entity whose value can change.
    2) It is a name given to a location in memeory.
* Variable names are case-sensitive and must begin with an alphabate.
* Total Keywords = 32. Example char, int, float, etc.
* printf() is a function that can print multiple constants and variables.
* Format specifiers in printf(), scanf() : int - %i, float - %f, char - %c.
* main() is a fucntion that must always return an integer value.
* 0 - if it meets success, 1 - if it encounters any failure.
* void main() is wrong, Correct form is int main().
* use /**/ or // for a comment in a program
* & is 'Address of' operator and must be used before a variable in scanf().
